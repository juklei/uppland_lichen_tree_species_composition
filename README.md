This is the analysis for the paper "Tree species identity and composition shape the epiphytic lichen community of structurally simple boreal forests over vast areas" in PlosONE with the DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0257564

The data used in the analysis can be downloaded from DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3899847

First run the scripts lichen_lto_prepare and lichen_sac_data_prepare. Then the two lichen models and then the figures.
The models run in JAGS, which means that some software needs to be downloaded.
